# README.md Generator

## Description

Every good project needs a quality README with information about the app - what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input about your project.

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

To generate your own README, `git clone` the repo down to your local so you have the Node project on your local.

Run `npm install` in order to install the following npm package dependencies as specified in the `package.json`:

The application will start by running `node index.js` in the command line.

Answer the prompts in your command line to generate the README.

After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named 'README.md' and will be ready for you at the root of the repo.

## Usage

[gif of usage](/giphy.mp4)

When you run `node index.js`, the application uses the `inquirer` package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project.
From there, the application will generate markdown and a table of contents for the README conditionally based on your responses to the Inquirer prompts (so, if you don't answer the optional questions, such as Installation, an Installation section will not be included in your README).
